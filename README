Simple repo to hold code for sensor system
 - using esp8266 on the sensor side with bme280;
 - raspberry pi as backbone to:
    - receive, manage and serve data with fastAPI;
    - store in postgres;
    - serve with streamlit;

VERY SIMPLE How tos



pi (DB, API, frontend)
install postgres and connect to it with pgadmin
run database_setup.sql on pgadmin
first CREATE DATABASE sensors;
then open sql window inside this database to them run other commands

install python3-venv

clone repo and cd into it
for each folder app and api:
update paths to match your user name
create services specified in README for api and app
create virtual envs
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
(.venv) python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

sudo systemctl start streamlit.service
sudo systemctl start sensorapi.service

go to http://pi-ip-localnetwork:8510 for frontend
go to http://pi-ip-localnetwork:5000 for API


esp8266 setup

install thonny IDE
connect esp8266 via usb to computer
install micropython on it
update code for your network ssid, password and fastapi url
upload code to device
test, add some prints and check pi setup
